# US-PresedentialElectionResult-Analysis

The map shows us the US presidential election results of all the 50 states. The margin of victory was calculated by the difference in their win percentage in a state and using the same set of values a plot was formed.  Blue color indicates Clinton’s victory while red indicates Trump’s. The darker the color, the more prominent their victory is. Similarly, if the margin of victory is narrow, shades of white and blue/red are seen in that polygonal region. The scale is shown to the right of the plot.
  Using the library, ‘fifty_stater’, map data of the 50 states including Hawaii and Alaska was downloaded. Later analysis is included in the R file.
